This project takes inventory of stocks and record sales of these stocks. It primarily aimed at solving trust related issues between shop owners and their sales assistants, by storing all stock items available in the store in a database and all sales made are also recorded in the database. 
Recording sales of an item or items, automatically reduces the recorded value of that item in the database. With this, shop owners can leave their shops in the care of their sales assistant or assistants, knowing fully well, that the quantity of an item in the database will never reduce except sales is made. Shop owners only need to verify that the physical quantity of an item in the store, is the same as the value in the database. If not, the sales assistant will have to make an explanation. The sales assistant can also verify the value of an item in the database.
Only the shop owners can update the attributes of an item or completely delete an item from the database, a check has been placed to ensure that the shop owners don't go about increasing the recoreded value of an item in the database without a means for the sales_assistant to verify this increase. 
It's been designed in such a way that it can be upgraded to an e-commerce platform. Only admin and staffs can login at the moment, since the register page isn't available yet. To access the full functionality of this platform, you must be logged in as an admin.
